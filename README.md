Inventry is a community-driven platform that helps FTC and robotics teams manage and share parts. Teams can track their inventory, request or lend parts to others, upload invoices to auto-add items, and see nearby teams on a map. Itâ€™s built with Next.js, Supabase, and MapLibre, with real-time updates and secure team-based data access.
